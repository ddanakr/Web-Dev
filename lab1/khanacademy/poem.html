    <h1>Winter</h1>
    <p>
    The street cars are <br>
    Like frosted cakes --<br>
    All covered up<br>
    With cold snowflakes.<br>
    <br>
    The horses' hoofs<br>
    Scrunch on the street;<br>
    Their eyelashes<br>
    Are white with sleet.<br>
    <br>
    And everywhere<br>
    The people go --<br>
    With faces tickled<br>
    By the snow.<br>
    </p>
